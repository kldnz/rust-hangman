This is a simple hangman game!

In the repostiroy there is not prebuilt code since all of it is ignored while uploading it to the repo

You get the cargo.toml and src file

simply run:

```cargo build```

and 

```cargo run```

To play the game

# TODO

Update the code to get a random word and not from a file
